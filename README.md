## Design

### Color Scheme
Dark and light blues and coral shades were used to match the water theme of the company and to coordinate with underwater images and provide a contrast for visual ease.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kimatron/fish-id), navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the **Main** Branch, then click "Save".
  - The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The live link can be found [here](https://kimatron.github.io/fish-id/)

## Local Deployment

In order to make a local copy of this project, you can clone it.
In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:

- `git clone https://github.com/kimatron/deepbreath.git`

## Potential Future Features

- In the future adding a feature to index local dive shops in a user's area via a mapping tool and linking them to dive shops in their locality would be beneficial.

 - This could also be beneficial to *us* by way of commission of sales possibly.

 - Adding a live booking feature would improve sales and increase response time rather than having to contact us and wait for a response.

## Testing

Please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for all test-related documentation and bugs.
