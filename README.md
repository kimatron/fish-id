# Fish Out Of Water

Fish out of water is site designed to help scuba diving students prepare for their underwater Fish Identification course.

The requirements to pass a Fish Identification course are to complete an underwater scuba dive with an instructor and correctly identify at least 8 different species of fish, and 5 different types of invertebrates. 

The flash cards show images of marine life for users to study and identify, and learn fun facts about the different animals.

The quiz shows images of fish and other sea creatures that can be found on local dive sites to help them prepare for the underwater exam, and gives users multiple choice questions for them to identify the fish. 

The site can be accessed through this

## Design

### Color Scheme
Dark and light blues and green shades were used to match the underwater and marine life theme so that the images would not clash, and also be more visually appealing to the user. A bright yellow/orange contrast was used to break up the monotony of the blues and to make certain features and information stand out.

### Typography

Main Font 
- Manrope is an open-source modern sans-serif font family, designed by Mikhail Sharanda in 2018 obtained from Google Font. It was used to attract viewers' attention while not being too formal and easy to read.

### Logo
- Logo was designed using a premade fish icon and creating my own style text to sit under it on [Canva](http.canva.com) ![logo](documentation/fishoutofwaterlogo.png)

## Credits
- Used [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) template to start off project.
- Sourced some style code ideas for adjusting photo size and layout from various sources online:
[w3schools](www.w3schools.com),
[Stackoverflow](Stackoverflow.com),
[FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org).
- Rewatched Love Math project from [Code Institute](www.codeinstitute.com) for inspiration on how to start setting up my site
- Read through some open source github code to get an idea how to set up the code for modals and flash cards, then worked my code around those ideas. For example, I checked the repository from an old javascript project which helped me to understand how everything in a quiz functioned together more. Used some of Iuliias code as a base for the flashcards to learn and play around with to add more depth and usefulness to the aim of the page, so editing it to my own as I went along [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova)  
- Used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to get a color scheme to match my images.
- All photos used were my own, taken by me or for me with permission by my co-worker Tony Land in the Cayman Islands. 
- Questions and content written by myself.

### Acknowledgments
- Thanks to Viola for keeping me sane and providing advice at silly o clock in the morning when my eyes weren't working anymore and joining me for a hackathon in the middle of the project, as if we didn't have enough to keep us awake at night :)
- And thanks to my mentor Juliia for not ignoring me and jumping in to answer all my annoying questions whenever she was asked :) https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova
