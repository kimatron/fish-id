# *YINGWEN*

YINGWEN app was build in order to ease the struggles that Chinese students experience daily. Since Chinese children are not allowed to study English besides school facilities nowadays, they have to attain tons of information for a short period by themselves. This app will help them to learn English and get the highest grades in their final exams. YINGWEN app is mainly aimed at enhancing English skills and passing the final English exams at primary and middle schools.

### Bugs
+ **Solved bugs**


1. The function that initiates the flipping of a flashcard did not allow the click on the pronunciation buttons to listen to the correct pronunciation of a word.

    - *Solutions:* Add ```event.stopPropagation();``` method to the speakFunction(), which takes two parameters: event and lang.
    
1. The audio played '/' as "slash" for the words that had two spelling variations.
        
    - *Solution:* Add ```replace();``` method with two parameters ```currentWord.replace('/', 'or');```to the speakFunction().

1.  The settings for input required in spelling_quiz.html did not work; therefore, if the input was empty, the user could check the spelling without typing a word in the input area.

    - *Solution:* Add if-else statement to the checkSpelling function that disables Check button if the input is empty and enable Check button if the input is not empty.

```js
const checkSpelling = function () {

  let answerInput = document.querySelector('#word__key--input');
  if (answerInput.value === '') {
    btnCheck.getAttribute("aria-disabled") === "true";
  } else {
    document.getElementsByClassName('word__key')[0].innerText = currentWord;
    btnCheck.getAttribute("aria-disabled") === "false";
    if (answerInput.value.toLowerCase() === currentWord) {
      answerInput.style.backgroundColor = '#008a5a';
    } else {
      answerInput.style.backgroundColor = '#c26ee3';
    }
  }
}
```
