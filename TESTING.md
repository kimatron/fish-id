# BUGS
- When initially trying to create image quiz, my images would not display, despite writing the code that should have allowed it to do so. I thought it was something to do with my script and function code, and kept trying to edit it there but nothing worked. I finally discovered I had simply placed an image div inside my question container div in the HTML file. Once I removed that the images showed fine. (DEV LIFE - insert peace sign here)
- When adding an image to the resultContainer to display when the results were shown, the image keeps appearing under the questions as well. Also, when I refresh the quiz, the results and the image aren't showing on the repeat of the quiz.
